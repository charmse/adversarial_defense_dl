# Defense Against Adversarial Examples in Deep Neural Networks

Here lies Cale Harms', Colton Harper's, and Krishnamohan Sunkara's CSCE 496 : Deep Learning project which tested different defense strategies on various adversarial attacks using the cleverhans library. We ran experiments using convolutional neural networks as well as trying to test on Google's inception model on the MNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet data sets.
